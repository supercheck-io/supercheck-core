**TASK**: Fix the failing Playwright test based on the detailed error report below.

**TEST TYPE CONTEXT**:
${testTypeInstructions}

**CURRENT FAILING SCRIPT**:
\`\`\`javascript
${failedScript}
\`\`\`

**DETAILED ERROR REPORT FROM PLAYWRIGHT**:
${optimizedMarkdown}

**FIXING GUIDELINES**:
1. **Preserve Intent**: Keep the original test logic and assertions intact
2. **Target Root Cause**: Fix only the specific issues mentioned in the error report
3. **Use Best Practices**: Apply Playwright best practices for reliability
4. **Minimal Changes**: Make the smallest changes necessary to fix the issue
5. **Preserve Comments**: Keep ALL existing comments and add brief inline comments explaining significant changes
6. **Maintain Structure**: Keep the existing test structure and variable names

**COMMON FIX PATTERNS**:
- Selector issues: Use more robust selectors (data-testid, role-based)
- Timing issues: Add proper waits (waitForSelector, waitForResponse)
- Element interaction: Ensure elements are visible/enabled before interaction
- Assertion problems: Use appropriate Playwright assertions with proper timeouts

**RESPONSE FORMAT**:
Respond with EXACTLY this structure:

FIXED_SCRIPT:
\`\`\`javascript
[Your complete fixed test script here]
\`\`\`

EXPLANATION:
[Brief explanation of what was changed and why - focus on the specific fixes made]

CONFIDENCE:
[Rate your confidence in this fix on a scale of 0.1 to 1.0, where 1.0 means you're very confident this will resolve the issue]

**IMPORTANT**:
- Return only valid, executable Playwright test code
- Preserve ALL existing comments from the original script
- Add your own comments only to explain the specific fixes you made
- Do not include test runners, imports, or setup code unless they were part of the original script`;

**TASK**: Analyze and improve the failing Playwright test script below.

**CONTEXT**: ${reason}

**TEST TYPE**: ${testType}
${testTypeInstructions}

**CURRENT SCRIPT**:
\`\`\`javascript
${failedScript}
\`\`\`

**ANALYSIS GUIDELINES**:
Since detailed error reports aren't available, please:
1. **Review Common Issues**: Look for typical Playwright problems (selectors, timing, assertions)
2. **Apply Best Practices**: Improve the script with Playwright best practices
3. **Add Robustness**: Include proper waits and error handling
4. **Maintain Intent**: Keep the original test logic and purpose
5. **Preserve Comments**: Keep ALL existing comments and add comments only to explain significant improvements made

**COMMON IMPROVEMENTS TO CONSIDER**:
- Replace brittle selectors with robust ones (data-testid, role-based)
- Add proper waits (waitForSelector, waitForLoadState)
- Use Playwright assertions instead of generic ones
- Add error handling for unreliable interactions
- Improve element interaction patterns

**RESPONSE FORMAT**:
FIXED_SCRIPT:
\`\`\`javascript
[Your improved test script here]
\`\`\`

EXPLANATION:
[Brief explanation of the improvements made to enhance test reliability]

CONFIDENCE:
[Rate your confidence in these improvements on a scale of 0.1 to 1.0, where 1.0 means you're very confident this will make the test more reliable]

**IMPORTANT**:
- Return only valid, executable Playwright test code
- Preserve ALL existing comments from the original script
- Add your own comments only to explain the specific improvements made`;
