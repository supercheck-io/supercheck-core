## Best Practices

### Testing Best Practices

#### Test Organization

<Steps>
  <Step>Group Related Tests</Step>
  <Step>Use Descriptive Naming</Step>
  <Step>Implement Proper Tagging</Step>
  <Step>Set Priority Levels</Step>
  <Step>Regular Review and Cleanup</Step>
</Steps>

**Test Organization Example:**

```javascript
// Test organization best practices
describe("User Authentication", () => {
  describe("Login Functionality", () => {
    test("valid user can login", async ({ page }) => {
      // Test implementation
    });

    test("invalid user cannot login", async ({ page }) => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });

  describe("Password Reset", () => {
    test("user can reset password", async ({ page }) => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

#### Test Data Management

**Data Management Best Practices:**

```javascript
// Test data management
const testData = {
  users: {
    valid: {
      username: "testuser",
      email: "test@example.com",
      password: "SecurePass123!",
    },
    invalid: {
      username: "invaliduser",
      email: "invalid@example.com",
      password: "wrongpassword",
    },
  },
  environments: {
    staging: "https://staging.example.com",
    production: "https://example.com",
  },
};
```

#### Test Performance Optimization

**Performance Best Practices:**

```javascript
// Performance optimization
test.describe.configure({
  timeout: 30000,
  retries: 2,
  parallel: true,
});

test("optimized test", async ({ page }) => {
  // Use efficient selectors
  const element = page.locator('[data-testid="submit-button"]');

  // Wait for specific conditions
  await element.waitFor({ state: "visible" });

  // Use actions efficiently
  await element.click();

  // Verify efficiently
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="success-message"]')).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Monitoring Best Practices

#### Monitor Configuration

**Monitor Setup Best Practices:**

```javascript
// Monitor configuration best practices
{

    config: {
      method: "GET",
      expectedStatusCodes: "200-299",
      timeoutSeconds: 30,
      headers: {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${API_KEY}",
        "User-Agent": "Supercheck-Monitor/1.0"
      }
    },
    alertConfig: {
      failureThreshold: 2,
      recoveryThreshold: 1,
      notificationChannels: ["email-alerts", "slack-critical"]
    }
  }
}
```

        headers: {
          "Authorization": "Bearer ${WEBHOOK_KEY}"
        }
      }
    },
    rules: {
      critical: {
        conditions: ["service_down", "data_loss"],
        channels: ["email", "slack", "webhook"],
        escalation: true
      },
      warning: {
