# Unified Data Lifecycle Management Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the **enterprise-grade unified data lifecycle management system** - the **ONLY** cleanup service in Supercheck. All previous individual cleanup files have been **removed** and consolidated into this single, robust, maintainable service.

## Evolution

### Before Consolidation (v1)

The system had **fragmented cleanup services**:

- ❌ **3 separate cleanup files** (`monitor-data-cleanup.ts`, `playground-cleanup.ts`, no run cleanup)
- ❌ **~2000 lines** of duplicated code
- ❌ **Inconsistent error handling** between services
- ❌ **Fallback complexity** in initialization
- ❌ **Maintenance burden** of managing multiple similar files

### After Consolidation (v2 - Current)

✅ **Single Unified Data Lifecycle Service** (`data-lifecycle-service.ts`):

- **✨ ONE FILE** - `app/src/lib/data-lifecycle-service.ts` (~900 lines)
- **✨ ALL cleanup logic** in one place
- **Pluggable strategy pattern** for different entity types
- **Consistent error handling, logging, and retry logic**
- **All cleanup types** (monitor results, job runs, playground artifacts)
- **Easy to extend** with new entity types
- **No fallback needed** - one service does it all

### Files Removed

- ~~`app/src/lib/monitor-data-cleanup.ts`~~ (deleted)
- ~~`app/src/lib/playground-cleanup.ts`~~ (deleted)

## Architecture

### Service Structure

```
DataLifecycleService
├── MonitorResultsCleanupStrategy
│   ├── Time-based retention (default: 30 days)
│   ├── Status change preservation
│   └── Batch processing (1000 records/batch)
│
├── JobRunsCleanupStrategy
│   ├── Time-based retention (default: 90 days)
│   ├── Associated S3 artifacts cleanup
│   ├── Reports table cleanup
│   └── Smaller batch size (100 records/batch)
│
└── PlaygroundArtifactsCleanupStrategy
    ├── Age-based S3 cleanup (default: 24 hours)
    ├── Direct S3 scanning
    └── No database operations
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Each entity type has its own cleanup strategy
2. **Single Queue**: All cleanups use one BullMQ queue
3. **Shared Infrastructure**: Common error handling, logging, retry logic
4. **Pluggable**: Easy to add new entity types
5. **Configurable**: Per-strategy configuration via environment variables
6. **Safe**: Dry-run support, safety limits, batch processing

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

#### Monitor Results Cleanup

```bash
MONITOR_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true              # Enable/disable monitor cleanup
MONITOR_CLEANUP_CRON="0 2 * * *"          # 2 AM daily
MONITOR_RETENTION_DAYS=30                 # Keep 30 days
MONITOR_CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE=1000           # Batch size
MONITOR_PRESERVE_STATUS_CHANGES=true      # Keep status transitions
MONITOR_CLEANUP_SAFETY_LIMIT=1000000      # Max records per run
```

#### Job Runs Cleanup (NEW)

```bash
JOB_RUNS_CLEANUP_ENABLED=false            # Disabled by default
JOB_RUNS_CLEANUP_CRON="0 3 * * *"         # 3 AM daily
JOB_RUNS_RETENTION_DAYS=90                # Keep 90 days
JOB_RUNS_CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE=100           # Smaller batches
JOB_RUNS_CLEANUP_SAFETY_LIMIT=10000       # Max records per run
```

#### Playground Artifacts Cleanup

```bash
PLAYGROUND_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true           # Enable playground cleanup
PLAYGROUND_CLEANUP_CRON="0 */12 * * *"    # Every 12 hours
PLAYGROUND_CLEANUP_MAX_AGE_HOURS=24       # Delete after 24 hours
```

### Why Different Defaults?

| Entity          | Default Retention | Reasoning                                |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Monitor Results | 30 days           | Frequent data, focus on recent trends    |
| Job Runs        | 90 days           | Less frequent, more valuable for history |
| Playground      | 24 hours          | Temporary test data only                 |

---

## Data Reduction Impact

### Monitor Results

With 30-day retention and status change preservation:

| Scale        | Records/Year (Before) | Records/Year (After) | Reduction |
| ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| 1 monitor    | 525,600               | 43,200               | **91.8%** |
| 100 monitors | 52.6M                 | 4.3M                 | **91.8%** |
| 500 monitors | 263M                  | 21.6M                | **91.8%** |

_Assumes 1-minute check intervals_

### Job Runs

With 90-day retention (assuming 10 jobs, 4 runs/day each):

| Scale    | Records/Year (Before) | Records/Year (After) | Reduction |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------------------- | --------- |
| 10 jobs  | 14,600                | 3,600                | **75.3%** |
| 100 jobs | 146,000               | 36,000               | **75.3%** |
| 500 jobs | 730,000               | 180,000              | **75.3%** |

### Playground Artifacts

With 24-hour retention:

- **S3 storage**: ~95% reduction in playground bucket size
- **Costs**: Significant S3 storage cost reduction

## Deployment

### Current State (No Migration Needed)

The system now uses **ONLY** the unified data lifecycle service:

1. **Single service** - `data-lifecycle-service.ts`
2. **No fallback** - individual cleanup files have been removed
3. **Automatic initialization** on application startup
4. **All cleanup jobs** scheduled via unified service

### Startup Sequence

```
🔄 Initializing unified data lifecycle service...
[DATA_LIFECYCLE] Initializing unified data lifecycle service
[DATA_LIFECYCLE] Registered strategy: monitor_results
[DATA_LIFECYCLE] Registered strategy: playground_artifacts
[DATA_LIFECYCLE] Initializing cleanup queue and worker...
[DATA_LIFECYCLE] Scheduled monitor_results cleanup successfully
[DATA_LIFECYCLE] Scheduled playground_artifacts cleanup successfully
✅ Unified data lifecycle service initialized successfully
   Enabled strategies: monitor_results, playground_artifacts
```

### Monitoring

Check BullMQ queue `data-lifecycle-cleanup`:

```bash
# Via Redis CLI
redis-cli
> KEYS *data-lifecycle-cleanup*

# Via application logs
grep "DATA_LIFECYCLE" logs/app.log
```

---

## Enabling Job Runs Cleanup

### Step 1: Set Environment Variable

```bash
JOB_RUNS_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true
```

### Step 2: Restart Application

The service will automatically:

1. Register the `JobRunsCleanupStrategy`
2. Schedule cleanup job with cron pattern
3. Start processing on schedule

### Step 3: Monitor First Run

```bash
# Check logs for cleanup execution
grep "job_runs" logs/app.log

# Expected output:
[DATA_LIFECYCLE] [job_runs] Cleaning runs older than 2024-XX-XX...
[DATA_LIFECYCLE] [job_runs] Found 150 old runs to clean up
[DATA_LIFECYCLE] [job_runs] Deleting 45 S3 artifacts
[DATA_LIFECYCLE] [job_runs] Deleted 150 runs and 45 S3 objects in 2345ms
```

## API Endpoints (Future Enhancement)

### Recommended Admin Routes

```typescript
// Get cleanup status
GET /api/admin/data-lifecycle/status

// Trigger manual cleanup
POST /api/admin/data-lifecycle/cleanup
{
  "entityType": "job_runs",
  "dryRun": true
}

// Get cleanup statistics
GET /api/admin/data-lifecycle/stats
```

**Status**: Not yet implemented (see Future Enhancements)

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Dry Run

Before enabling cleanup:

```typescript
const service = getDataLifecycleService();
const result = await service.triggerManualCleanup("job_runs", true);
console.log(`Would delete ${result.recordsDeleted} records`);
```

### 2. Monitor First Runs

- Check logs for errors
- Verify correct record counts
- Confirm S3 deletions are working

### 3. Adjust Batch Sizes

If cleanup is slow:

- **Increase batch size** for faster cleanup
- **Decrease batch size** to reduce database load

### 4. Set Safety Limits

Always use safety limits to prevent runaway deletions:

```bash
JOB_RUNS_CLEANUP_SAFETY_LIMIT=10000  # Max 10k records per run
```

### 5. Schedule Wisely

- **Off-peak hours**: Schedule cleanups at 2-4 AM
- **Stagger cleanups**: Don't run all at the same time
- **Monitor impact**: Watch database performance during cleanup

---

## Troubleshooting

### Cleanup Not Running

**Check 1**: Is service initialized?

```bash
grep "DATA_LIFECYCLE.*Initialized successfully" logs/app.log
```

**Check 2**: Are strategies registered?

```bash
grep "Registered strategy" logs/app.log
```

**Check 3**: Is cron pattern valid?

```bash
# Invalid pattern will cause errors
Invalid cron schedule for job_runs: */5 * * * * *
```

### Records Not Being Deleted

**Check 1**: Is entity cleanup enabled?

```bash
JOB_RUNS_CLEANUP_ENABLED=true
```

**Check 2**: Are records old enough?

```bash
# With 90-day retention, only records older than 90 days are deleted
```

**Check 3**: Check safety limits

```bash
# If limit reached, cleanup stops
Safety limit reached for job_runs. Deleted 10000 records but may have more to clean.
```

### S3 Artifacts Not Deleted

**Check 1**: S3 credentials correct?

```bash
[S3_CLEANUP] Failed to delete: Access Denied
```

**Check 2**: Bucket names correct?

```bash
S3_JOB_BUCKET_NAME=playwright-job-artifacts
S3_TEST_BUCKET_NAME=playwright-test-artifacts
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Tiered Aggregation Strategy

Instead of simple deletion, aggregate old data:

- **Last 24 hours**: Keep ALL records
- **Last 7 days**: Keep 1 record every 10 minutes
- **Last 30 days**: Keep 1 record every hour
- **Last 90 days**: Keep 1 record every 6 hours
- **Older**: Keep 1 record per day

**Impact**: 99%+ data reduction while preserving trends

### 2. Admin API

Add RESTful API for cleanup management:

- Manual triggering
- Dry-run analysis
- Real-time statistics
- Configuration updates

### 3. Metrics & Alerting

Add Prometheus metrics:

```typescript
data_lifecycle_records_deleted_total{entity="job_runs"}
data_lifecycle_cleanup_duration_seconds{entity="monitor_results"}
data_lifecycle_cleanup_errors_total{entity="playground_artifacts"}
```

### 4. Intelligent Scheduling

Auto-adjust cleanup frequency based on:

- Database size
- Growth rate
- System load

### 5. Archival Strategy

Before deletion, archive to:

- Cold storage (S3 Glacier)
- Data warehouse (BigQuery, Redshift)
- Backup system
