✅ Prefer web interfaces over CLI
✅ Multiple non-technical team members need access
✅ Time-to-market is critical

Project Characteristics:
✅ Early-stage development
✅ Frequent deployments needed
✅ Team collaboration is priority
✅ Resource overhead is acceptable
```

### **Migration Strategy:**

#### **Phase 1: Start with Manual (Recommended)**
```yaml
Initial Setup:
├── Deploy manual Docker Swarm on Hetzner
├── Learn Docker Swarm fundamentals
├── Optimize for Supercheck workloads
├── Achieve cost efficiency with shared ARM servers
└── Validate architecture with real users
```

#### **Phase 2: Evaluate Dokploy (Optional)**
```yaml
Consider Migration If:
├── Team grows beyond 5 developers
├── Non-technical team members need access
├── Deployment frequency increases significantly
├── Manual management becomes bottleneck
└── Resource overhead becomes acceptable cost
```

### **Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds):**
```yaml
Recommended Strategy:
├── Production: Manual Docker Swarm (performance + cost)
├── Development: Dokploy (rapid iteration)
├── Testing: Manual (resource efficiency)
└── Demo/Staging: Dokploy (team access)
```

- [ ] Configure external database connections (Neon, Redis Cloud)
- [ ] Setup user permissions for team members
- [ ] Configure automated backups through Dokploy
- [ ] Test deployment workflows

### **If Choosing Hybrid Approach:**
- [ ] Setup production with manual Docker Swarm
- [ ] Setup development environment with Dokploy

## 💡 Summary

**For Supercheck specifically, manual Docker Swarm on Hetzner shared ARM servers provides:**

- **68% cost savings** vs dedicated servers
- **Maximum performance** for concurrent test execution
- **Direct control** for optimization and troubleshooting
- **Industry-standard skills** and no vendor lock-in
- **Enterprise-grade reliability** with Docker Swarm

**Dokploy is excellent for teams prioritizing:**
- Rapid development iteration
- Web-based management
- Team collaboration features
- Reduced Docker Swarm learning curve

**Bottom line**: Start with manual Docker Swarm to maximize cost efficiency and performance for your paid Supercheck plans. Consider Dokploy later if team collaboration becomes a higher priority than resource optimization.

The manual approach aligns perfectly with test automation workloads where every CPU cycle and MB of RAM translates directly to more concurrent tests and better customer value! 🚀
