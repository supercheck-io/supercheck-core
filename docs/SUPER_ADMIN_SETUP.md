# Super Admin Setup Guide

## 🔐 Setting Up Your First Super Admin

Since environment variables are no longer used for security reasons, follow this secure process to set up your first super admin.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Database must be running** and migrations applied
2. **Application must be deployed** (or running locally)
3. **User must sign up first** with their email

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1️⃣ **User Signs Up**

Have your designated admin user register through your application's sign-up page:

```
https://your-app.com/sign-up
```

They should use the email you want to make a super admin (e.g., `admin@yourcompany.com`)

#### 2️⃣ **Run Bootstrap Script**

**Option A: Using npm script (Recommended)**

```bash
cd app
npm run setup:admin admin@yourcompany.com
```

**Option B: Direct execution**

```bash
npx tsx app/src/lib/bootstrap-super-admin.ts admin@yourcompany.com
```

**Option C: From root directory**

```bash
npx tsx ./app/src/lib/bootstrap-super-admin.ts admin@yourcompany.com
```

#### 3️⃣ **Verify Success**

You should see:

```
✅ SUCCESS: Successfully bootstrapped admin@yourcompany.com as first super admin

📝 Next steps:
1. The user must sign up with this email first if they haven't already
2. Once signed up, they will have super admin privileges
3. They can then grant admin access to other users via the UI

⚠️  SECURITY: Remove this script after initial setup
```

> **Note:** You may see "⚠️ Audit logging skipped (script context)" - this is normal when running outside a request context. The bootstrap operation completes successfully and the role is assigned.

#### 4️⃣ **User Logs In**

The admin user can now log in and access super admin features in the UI.

## Adding More Super Admins

Once you have your first super admin, you can grant super admin privileges to other users **through the UI**:

1. Log in as super admin
2. Go to Admin Panel → Users
3. Find the user
4. Click "Grant Super Admin"

This will:

- ✅ Update their role in the database
- ✅ Invalidate their sessions (force re-login)
- ✅ Log the action in audit trail

---

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ Error: "User not found"

**Cause:** The user hasn't signed up yet.

**Solution:**

1. Ask the user to sign up first at `/sign-up`
2. Run the bootstrap script again

### ❌ Error: "Super admins already exist"

**Cause:** You already have at least one super admin.

**Solution:**

- Use the existing super admin to grant privileges to other users via the UI
- Or use programmatic approach (see below)

### ❌ Error: "Cannot connect to database"

**Cause:** Database is not running or connection string is wrong.

**Solution:**

1. Check your database is running: `docker-compose ps`
2. Verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
3. Run migrations: `npm run db:migrate`

---

## Programmatic Approach

For automation or advanced use cases, you can use the functions directly:

```typescript
import {
  bootstrapFirstSuperAdmin,
  grantSuperAdmin,
  revokeSuperAdmin,
} from "@/lib/rbac/super-admin";

// Bootstrap first admin (one-time only)
const result = await bootstrapFirstSuperAdmin(
  "admin@example.com",
  "automation-script"
);

if (result.success) {
  console.log("✅", result.message);
} else {
  console.error("❌", result.message);
}

// Grant super admin to another user (requires existing super admin)
await grantSuperAdmin(
  "target-user-id", // User to promote
  "granter-user-id" // Existing super admin performing the action
);

// Revoke super admin from user
await revokeSuperAdmin(
  "target-user-id", // User to demote
  "revoker-user-id" // Existing super admin performing the action
);
```

## Security Features

### ✅ What's Secure

1. **Database-Only Storage** - No environment variable dependency
2. **Duplicate Prevention** - Bootstrap fails if admins already exist
3. **Session Invalidation** - Automatic logout on role changes
4. **Audit Logging** - All admin actions are logged
5. **Authorization Required** - Only super admins can grant/revoke

### 🔒 Best Practices

1. **Remove Bootstrap Script** - After initial setup, delete or restrict access to `app/src/lib/bootstrap-super-admin.ts`
2. **Use UI for Additional Admins** - Don't re-run bootstrap; use the admin panel
3. **Monitor Audit Logs** - Regularly review admin actions
4. **Limit Super Admins** - Only grant to trusted personnel
5. **Regular Reviews** - Periodically audit who has super admin access

---

## Migration from Environment Variables

If you previously used `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable:

### Old Method (Insecure) ❌

```bash
# .env
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS="admin@example.com,admin2@example.com"
```

### New Method (Secure) ✅

**For First Admin:**

```bash
npm run setup:admin admin@example.com
```

**For Additional Admins:**
Use the admin UI to grant super admin privileges.

## Docker/Production Deployment

### During Initial Deployment

Add to your deployment script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy.sh

# 1. Run migrations
npm run db:migrate:prod

# 2. Start the application
npm run start &

# 3. Wait for app to be ready
sleep 10

# 4. Bootstrap super admin (only on first deployment)
if [ "$FIRST_DEPLOY" = "true" ]; then
  npm run setup:admin $ADMIN_EMAIL
fi
```

### Using Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  app:
    image: your-app:latest
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      # No SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS needed anymore!
    command: >
      sh -c "
        npm run db:migrate:prod &&
        npm run start
      "

  # Optional: One-time admin bootstrap job
  admin-bootstrap:
    image: your-app:latest
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
    command: npm run setup:admin ${ADMIN_EMAIL}
    restart: "no" # Run once only
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I still use environment variables for super admin?**
A: No, this was removed for security. Environment variables can be easily exposed or manipulated. The database is now the single source of truth.

**Q: What if I lose access to all super admins?**
A: You can bootstrap a new super admin, but only if NO super admins exist. Otherwise, you'll need database-level access to manually update the user table.

**Q: How many super admins can I have?**
A: Unlimited, but for security best practices, keep it minimal (2-3 maximum).

**Q: Can super admins be demoted?**
A: Yes, via `revokeSuperAdmin()` or the admin UI. They cannot demote themselves, and you cannot demote the last super admin.

**Q: Are role changes logged?**
A: Yes, all super admin grants/revokes are logged in the audit trail with full context.
