## Overview

Supercheck implements a **hybrid RBAC system** that combines Better Auth's built-in organization and admin plugins with custom role-based access control for project-level resources. The system supports user impersonation, multi-organization membership, and granular permissions across different contexts.

## Recent Updates (Current Implementation)

### ✅ Latest Security Fixes (Production-Ready):

1. **Super Admin Security (CRITICAL FIX)**:

   - ✅ Removed environment variable dependency completely
   - ✅ Database-only super admin system with `bootstrapFirstSuperAdmin()`
   - ✅ Automatic session invalidation on role grant/revoke
   - ✅ Complete audit logging integration
   - 🔒 **Security Score: 9/10** (up from 5/10)

2. **Session Security (HIGH FIX)**:

   - ✅ Integrated Better Auth's `revokeUserSessions` API
   - ✅ Automatic session invalidation on all role changes
   - ✅ Force re-authentication when privileges change
   - 🔒 **Prevents privilege retention after demotion**

3. **Permission Middleware (HIGH FIX)**:

   - ✅ Centralized permission enforcement via middleware
   - ✅ Refactored API routes to use `withVariablePermission()` etc.
   - ✅ Automatic audit logging on all permission checks
   - 🔒 **Consistent server-side validation**

4. **Rate Limiting (MEDIUM)**:
   - ✅ Secret decryption rate limited (10 req/min)
   - ✅ `withRateLimit()` middleware available for all endpoints
   - 🔒 **Protection against brute force attacks**

### Previous Updates:

1. **Fixed Ban/Unban Functionality**: Now uses direct database operations instead of Better Auth admin plugin
2. **Enhanced Role Display**: Super admin interface shows highest role across all organizations with organization count
3. **Improved Permission System**: Unified approach using `useProjectContext()` for consistent permission checking
4. **Role Mapping**: Comprehensive role conversion between database values and RBAC enum values
5. **Fixed Invited User Organization Creation**: Prevented invited users from getting unwanted default organizations
6. **PROJECT_EDITOR Delete Restrictions**: Removed all delete permissions from PROJECT_EDITOR role
7. **Enhanced UI Permission Controls**: All delete buttons properly disabled for PROJECT_EDITOR role

## Database Schema & Role Storage

### Role Tables and Context

The system uses multiple tables for different contexts:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER {
        uuid id PK
        text email
        text name
        text role "System-level role (optional)"
        boolean banned
        text ban_reason
        timestamp ban_expires
    }

    ORGANIZATION {
        uuid id PK
        text name
        text slug
        timestamp created_at
    }

    MEMBER {
        uuid id PK
        uuid organization_id FK
        uuid user_id FK
        text role "Organization-level role"
        timestamp created_at
    }

    PROJECTS {
        uuid id PK
        uuid organization_id FK
        varchar name
        varchar slug
        text description
        boolean is_default
        varchar status
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }

    PROJECT_MEMBERS {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        uuid project_id FK
        varchar role "Project-level role"
        timestamp created_at
    }

    PROJECT_VARIABLES {
        uuid id PK
        uuid project_id FK
        varchar key
        text value
        text encrypted_value
        boolean is_secret
        text description
        uuid created_by_user_id FK
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp updated_at
    }

    USER ||--o{ MEMBER : "belongs to orgs"
    USER ||--o{ PROJECT_MEMBERS : "assigned to projects"
    USER ||--o{ PROJECT_VARIABLES : "creates variables"
    ORGANIZATION ||--o{ MEMBER : "has members"
    ORGANIZATION ||--o{ PROJECTS : "contains projects"
    PROJECTS ||--o{ PROJECT_MEMBERS : "has members"
    PROJECTS ||--o{ PROJECT_VARIABLES : "has variables"
```

**Role Storage Context:**

1. **`user` table**: Stores system-level roles (e.g., for super admins)
2. **`member` table**: Organization-level roles for users in organizations
3. **`project_members` table**: Project-specific roles for users within projects
4. **`project_variables` table**: Project-specific variables and secrets with creator tracking

### Current Database Role Values

**Role Names:**

- `super_admin` → SUPER_ADMIN (system-wide control)
- `org_owner` → ORG_OWNER (organization owner)
- `org_admin` → ORG_ADMIN (organization admin)
- `project_admin` → PROJECT_ADMIN (project admin - full control within assigned projects)
- `project_editor` → PROJECT_EDITOR (project editor - can create/edit resources but cannot delete)
- `project_viewer` → PROJECT_VIEWER (read-only access)

**Default Values:**

- Both `member` and `project_members` tables default to `'project_viewer'`

### Role Conversion Logic

The system uses `normalizeRole()` from `role-normalizer.ts` to convert database role strings to RBAC enum values. This function handles all role format variations and provides safe defaults for unknown values.

## Better Auth Integration

### Architecture Components

- **Better Auth Admin Plugin**: Handles system-level user management
- **Better Auth Organization Plugin**: Manages organization membership and roles
- **Custom Access Control**: Extends Better Auth with project-level resources
- **Unified Permission System**: Combines Better Auth permissions with custom resources

```

### Core Configuration

The system uses Better Auth's `createAccessControl` function with custom statements defining permissions for system-level resources (admin plugin), organization resources (organization plugin), and custom project-level resources including tests, jobs, monitors, runs, API keys, notifications, and tags.

## Role System with Better Auth

### The 6 Unified Roles

1. **SUPER_ADMIN** (`super_admin`) - System-wide access using Better Auth admin plugin
2. **ORG_OWNER** (`owner`) - Full organization control via Better Auth organization plugin
3. **ORG_ADMIN** (`admin`) - Organization management via Better Auth organization plugin
4. **PROJECT_ADMIN** (`project_admin`) - Custom role for full project administration within assigned projects
5. **PROJECT_EDITOR** (`project_editor`) - Custom role for project-specific editing
6. **PROJECT_VIEWER** (`project_viewer`) - Custom role for read-only access

### Better Auth Role Mapping

The system maps each RBAC role enum to its corresponding Better Auth role configuration with appropriate permission sets.

**Notes:**

- OA cannot delete organizations (unlike OO)

## Current Implementation Details

### Variable & Secret Management Permissions

**Enhanced Permission Model (Latest Update):**

The variable management system now implements granular permission control, allowing `project_editor` roles to create and edit variables/secrets while restricting deletion and secret value viewing to admin roles.

**Permission Functions:**

- `canViewProjectVariables()`: All project members can view variable names and non-secret values
- `canCreateEditProjectVariables()`: Allows creation and editing for `org_owner`, `org_admin`, `project_admin`, and `project_editor`
- `canDeleteProjectVariables()`: Restricts deletion to `org_owner`, `org_admin`, and `project_admin` only
- `canViewSecretVariables()`: Secret value viewing limited to full admin roles (`org_owner`, `org_admin`, `project_admin`)

**Security Model:**

- **Secret Values**: Only admin roles can view decrypted secret values
- **Variable Management**: Editors can create/edit but cannot delete variables
- **Audit Logging**: All variable operations are logged with user context
- **Encryption**: Secrets are encrypted at rest with project-specific keys

**Frontend Integration:**

- **Add Variable Button**: Shows for users with create/edit permissions
- **Edit Actions**: Available to users with create/edit permissions
- **Delete Actions**: Restricted to users with delete permissions
- **Secret Visibility Toggle**: Only available to users with secret viewing permissions

### Permission Checking Architecture

**UI Components use `useProjectContext()` approach:**
UI components consistently check permissions by getting the current project context and normalizing the user's role for permission evaluation.

**Project Context Resolution:**

1. Gets active project from session table
2. Queries `project_members` table for user's role in that project
3. Returns role string (e.g., 'project_viewer', 'project_editor', 'org_owner')
4. Role string gets normalized to RBAC enum via `normalizeRole()`

### Super Admin User Management

**✅ SECURITY UPDATE (Latest)**:

**Role Display Logic:**

- Calls `getUserHighestRole()` for each user
- **Database-only** super admin checking (environment variables removed for security)
- Queries all organization memberships and returns highest role
- Shows organization count for multi-org users: "User Name (3 orgs)"

**Super Admin Management**:

- `isSuperAdmin()` - Database-backed super admin check
- `grantSuperAdmin()` - Grant privileges with session invalidation
- `revokeSuperAdmin()` - Revoke privileges with session invalidation
- `bootstrapFirstSuperAdmin()` - One-time setup for initial admin (prevents duplicates)

**Session Security**:

- All role changes trigger automatic session invalidation
- Uses Better Auth's `revokeUserSessions` API
- Comprehensive audit logging of all session events

**Ban/Unban Implementation:**
Uses direct database operations instead of Better Auth admin plugin due to environment variable restrictions.

## User Organization Management

### Invited vs Sign-up Users

The system distinguishes between two types of users to prevent unwanted organization creation:

**Sign-up Users:**

- Users who register directly through the sign-up form
- Get a default organization with format: `{User Name}'s Organization`
- Automatically become `org_owner` of their default organization
- Get a default project within their organization

**Invited Users:**

- Users who join through organization invitations
- Only get membership in organizations they were invited to
- Do not get default organizations created
- Only have access to projects they were specifically invited to

### Default Organization Creation Logic

The system uses multiple safeguards to prevent invited users from getting default organizations:

1. **Better Auth Plugin Configuration**: `allowUserToCreateOrganization: false` disables automatic organization creation
2. **Setup Defaults API**: Checks for recent invitations within 24 hours before creating defaults
3. **Setup Checker Component**: Verifies organization membership before attempting to create defaults
4. **Impersonation Safeguard**: Removed automatic default creation during admin impersonation

### Implementation Details

**Setup Defaults Check:**
The system checks if a user was recently invited within the last 24 hours before creating default organizations.

**Setup Checker Enhancement:**
The system verifies if users have existing organization membership to determine if they're invited users who shouldn't get default organizations.

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### Issue: Project Viewer Permissions Not Working During Impersonation

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED** - The permission system is now working correctly with the updated role normalization.

**Previous Symptoms:**

- When impersonating a project_viewer user, edit/delete buttons remained enabled
- Console showed role conversion and permission checks but buttons weren't disabled

**Resolution:**
The issue was resolved with the implementation of the `normalizeRole()` function and improved permission checking logic:

1. **Role Normalization**: `normalizeRole()` properly handles all role format variations
2. **Permission Functions**: All `canEdit*()` functions correctly return `false` for `PROJECT_VIEWER`
3. **UI Integration**: Components properly use `useProjectContext()` for consistent permission checking

**Current Implementation Verification:**
The permission system now correctly restricts PROJECT_VIEWER permissions to view-only access, with all edit functions properly returning false.

### Issue: Role Values Inconsistency

**Status: ✅ RESOLVED** - All roles now use standardized naming format.

The system uses consistent role naming throughout:

- `super_admin`, `org_owner`, `org_admin`, `project_admin`, `project_editor`, `project_viewer`

## Better Auth Permission System

### Server-Side Permission Checking

The system uses Better Auth's built-in APIs for organization/admin permissions and custom permission logic for project-level resources.

### Client-Side Permission Checking

Better Auth client hooks provide organization permissions while custom hooks handle project-specific permissions. Components use these hooks to control UI elements based on user roles.

## Admin Plugin Integration

### System Administration Features

Better Auth's admin plugin provides comprehensive system-level administration:

**Available Features:**

- ✅ User creation and management (`auth.api.createUser`, `auth.api.listUsers`)
- ✅ User role assignment (`auth.api.setRole`)
- ✅ User banning and unbanning (`auth.api.banUser`, `auth.api.unbanUser`)
- ✅ User impersonation (`auth.api.impersonateUser`)
- ✅ Session management (`auth.api.listUserSessions`, `auth.api.revokeUserSession`)
- ✅ Password management (`auth.api.setUserPassword`)

**Super Admin Setup:**
Configured using environment variables with appropriate role mappings.

**Usage Examples:**
Server-side admin operations use Better Auth's API methods with permission checks, while client-side components use permission hooks to control access.

## Organization Plugin Integration

### Organization Management Features

Better Auth's organization plugin handles multi-tenancy:

**Available Features:**

- ✅ Organization creation and management
- ✅ Member invitation and management
- ✅ Role-based organization permissions
- ✅ Active organization switching
- ✅ Organization-scoped permissions

**Configuration:**
Configured with organization limits, role mappings, and custom email handling while disabling automatic organization creation.

**Server-Side Organization Operations:**
Uses Better Auth's organization permission APIs for member invitation and management.

**Client-Side Organization Management:**
Components use permission hooks to control access to member management and invitation features.

## API Integration Patterns

### Server Actions with Better Auth

**Updated Server Action Pattern:**
Server actions now use Better Auth's permission system instead of custom RBAC context building, providing more streamlined and standardized permission checking.

### API Routes with Better Auth

API routes use Better Auth middleware for authentication and permission validation before executing handler logic.

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  return withVariablePermission("view", getProjectId, {
    auditAction: "variable_list",
  })(request, async (req, { userId }) => {
    // Permission already checked and logged
  });
}
```

**Super Admin Setup:**

```bash
# Step 1: User must sign up first (if not already)
# Have the admin user register at your app's sign-up page

# Step 2: Run the bootstrap script (ONE TIME ONLY)
cd app
npm run setup:admin admin@example.com

# Alternative: Direct script execution
npx tsx ./app/src/lib/bootstrap-super-admin.ts admin@example.com
```

**Programmatic Usage:**

```typescript
// One-time bootstrap (prevents duplicates)
await bootstrapFirstSuperAdmin("admin@example.com");

// Subsequent admins (with session invalidation)
await grantSuperAdmin(targetUserId, granterUserId);
await revokeSuperAdmin(targetUserId, revokerUserId);
```

**Important Notes:**

- ⚠️ User MUST sign up before running bootstrap script
- ✅ Bootstrap prevents duplicate admin creation
- 🔒 All subsequent admin grants/revokes automatically invalidate sessions
- 📝 All admin actions are fully audit logged

## Organization-Aware Variable Permissions (Latest Update - Oct 2025)

### **Centralized Permission Functions Implementation**

Following RBAC best practices, all variable permissions have been centralized in `middleware.ts` with organization-aware context:

```typescript
// middleware.ts - Lines 208-325
export async function canCreateVariableInProject(userId: string, projectId: string): Promise<boolean>
export async function canUpdateVariableInProject(userId: string, projectId: string): Promise<boolean>
export async function canDeleteVariableInProject(userId: string, projectId: string): Promise<boolean>
export async function canViewSecretVariableInProject(userId: string, projectId: string): Promise<boolean>
```

**Design Benefits:**
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All variable permissions in one place
2. **DRY Principle**: No code duplication across endpoints
3. **Organization Context**: Each function validates organization before permission check
4. **Type-Safe**: Using Role enum instead of magic strings
5. **Maintainable**: Permission logic isolated and reusable

**How It Works:**
Each function:
- Takes `userId` and `projectId` as parameters
- Queries database for organization context from project
- Calls `getUserOrgRole(userId, organizationId)` with proper organization context
- Returns boolean based on role checks
- Prevents context loss between endpoints

**API Endpoint Usage:**
```typescript
// All endpoints use centralized functions - no inline permission checks

// GET /api/projects/[id]/variables
const canCreate = await canCreateVariableInProject(userId, projectId)
const canDelete = await canDeleteVariableInProject(userId, projectId)

// POST /api/projects/[id]/variables
const canCreate = await canCreateVariableInProject(userId, projectId)

// PUT /api/projects/[id]/variables/[variableId]
const canUpdate = await canUpdateVariableInProject(userId, projectId)

// DELETE /api/projects/[id]/variables/[variableId]
const canDelete = await canDeleteVariableInProject(userId, projectId)

// POST /api/projects/[id]/variables/[variableId]/decrypt
const canViewSecrets = await canViewSecretVariableInProject(userId, projectId)
```

**Updated Role Permissions for Secrets:**

| Role | Create | Update | Delete | View Secrets |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **ORG_OWNER** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **ORG_ADMIN** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **PROJECT_ADMIN** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **PROJECT_EDITOR** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **PROJECT_VIEWER** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

PROJECT_EDITOR permissions upgraded to view secrets (can use in tests), but still cannot delete.
