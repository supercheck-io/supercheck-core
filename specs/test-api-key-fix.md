# API Key Fix Test Guide

## Test Steps

### 1. Create an API Key
1. Navigate to a job's CI/CD settings
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Test Key")
4. Click "Create API Key"
5. **Expected Result**: API key should be created successfully without "Unauthorized or invalid session" error

### 2. Test API Key Verification
1. Copy the generated API key
2. Use curl to test the trigger endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/jobs/{jobId}/trigger" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: {your-api-key}"
```
3. **Expected Result**: Should return success response with job execution details, not "Invalid API key" or "Invalid job data" errors

### 3. Test API Key Management
1. Try toggling the API key enabled/disabled state
2. Try updating the API key name
3. Try deleting the API key
4. **Expected Result**: All operations should work without errors

## What Was Fixed

### Before:
- ❌ API key creation failed with "Unauthorized or invalid session"
- ❌ API key verification failed with "Invalid API key"
- ❌ Job triggering failed with "Invalid job data. Job ID and tests are required"
- ❌ Better-auth API limitations prevented proper operation

### After:
- ✅ API key creation works with direct database operations
- ✅ API key verification works with custom database queries
- ✅ All API key management operations work reliably
- ✅ Proper session validation and security maintained
- ✅ Job-specific permissions work correctly
- ✅ Job triggering works with proper test data inclusion

## Technical Details

### API Key Creation:
- Direct database insertion with proper user association
- Secure key generation with UUID-based format
- JSON permissions storage for job-specific access

### API Key Verification:
- Direct database lookup by key value
- Proper validation of enabled status and expiration
- JSON parsing of permissions for job access control

### Security Maintained:
- Session validation required for all operations
- API keys associated with authenticated users
- Proper permission scoping to specific jobs
- Database operations use parameterized queries
