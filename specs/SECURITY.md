# Security Configuration Guide

This document outlines the security configurations required for production deployments.

## üîê Redis Security (Critical)

### Issue
By default, Redis is accessible without authentication and may be publicly exposed, creating a security vulnerability.

### Solution
The updated `docker-compose.yml` includes the following security measures:

1. **Authentication Required**: Redis now requires a password
2. **No Public Port**: Redis port is not exposed outside the Docker network
3. **Protected Mode**: Redis runs in protected mode

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Redis Security - CHANGE THIS PASSWORD!
REDIS_PASSWORD=your-super-secure-redis-password-change-this-immediately
```

#### Docker Compose Changes
```yaml
# Redis is now configured with:
# - Password authentication
# - No public port exposure
# - Protected mode enabled
redis:
  environment:
    - REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD:-supersecure-redis-password-change-this}
  command: redis-server --requirepass "${REDIS_PASSWORD}" --protected-mode yes
  # No ports section - only accessible within Docker network
```

#### Connection Strings
Both services now use authenticated Redis URLs:
```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://:${REDIS_PASSWORD}@redis:6379
```

## üö® Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying:

1. **Change Default Passwords**
   ```bash
   # Update in .env file
   REDIS_PASSWORD=your-unique-secure-password
   BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-unique-auth-secret
   ```

2. **Verify Security Settings**
   ```bash
   # Check Redis is not publicly accessible
   nmap -p 6379 your-server-ip
   # Should show: 6379/tcp closed
   ```

3. **Database Security**
   - Use strong PostgreSQL passwords
   - Limit database access to application containers only
   - Consider using SSL connections for database

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit sensitive data to version control
   - Use secure methods to deploy environment variables
   - Rotate secrets regularly

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Measures

### Network Security
- Use Docker's internal networks (already configured)
- Consider using Docker secrets for sensitive data
- Implement reverse proxy with SSL termination

### Application Security
- Email notifications use environment variables only (no UI exposure of SMTP credentials)
- API keys have proper rate limiting
- Input validation on all endpoints

### Monitoring
- Monitor failed login attempts
- Set up alerts for unusual activity
- Regular security audits

## üîß Testing Security

### Redis Security Test
```bash
# From outside Docker network - should fail
redis-cli -h your-server-ip -p 6379 ping
# Error: Could not connect

# From inside Docker network - should work with password
docker exec -it supercheck-redis-1 redis-cli -a your-password ping
# PONG
```

### Port Scanning
```bash
# Check what ports are publicly accessible
nmap -sS your-server-ip
# Should only show necessary ports (80, 443, SSH)
```

## üìû Incident Response

If you receive security notifications (like the BSI Redis report):

1. **Immediate Action**: Stop the affected service
2. **Assess Impact**: Check if data was compromised
3. **Fix Configuration**: Apply security patches
4. **Monitor**: Watch for unusual activity
5. **Report**: Document the incident and resolution

## üîÑ Regular Maintenance

- Update container images regularly
- Review and rotate secrets quarterly
- Monitor security advisories for dependencies
- Perform regular security scans

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Stay vigilant and keep your systems updated.
