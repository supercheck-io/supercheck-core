### Active Monitor Scheduling & Execution

#### 1. **`monitor-scheduler`**
- **Purpose**: Manages the schedules for all active monitors
- **Job Type**: Repeating jobs with cron-like scheduling
- **Reliability**: Job persistence, failure recovery, and dead letter handling

- **Purpose**: Executes actual monitor checks with enterprise-grade reliability
- **Job Type**: One-time jobs with retry logic and resource management
- **Security**: All jobs validated, credentials encrypted, and resources managed
- **How it Works**: The MonitorProcessor listens to this queue, executes checks using enhanced security services, and processes alerts.

### Queue Benefits

#### **Reliability**

- Retry logic with exponential backoff handles transient failures
- Dead letter queues capture failed jobs for analysis
- Resource limits prevent system overload

## Configuration

### Monitor Configuration Structure

```typescript
interface MonitorConfig {
  // HTTP/Website specific
  method?: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE' | 'PATCH' | 'HEAD' | 'OPTIONS';
  headers?: Record<string, string>;
  body?: string;
  expectedStatusCodes?: string;
  keywordInBody?: string;
  keywordInBodyShouldBePresent?: boolean;
  
  // Authentication (encrypted at rest)
  auth?: {
    type: 'none' | 'basic' | 'bearer';
    username?: string;
    password?: string;
    token?: string;
  };
  
  // SSL monitoring
  enableSslCheck?: boolean;
  sslDaysUntilExpirationWarning?: number;
  
  // Timing and validation
  timeoutSeconds?: number;
  
  // Port monitoring
  protocol?: 'tcp' | 'udp';
  port?: number;
}
```

### Security Configuration

```typescript
interface SecurityConfig {
  allowInternalTargets?: boolean;
  maxStringLength?: number;
  allowedProtocols?: string[];
  requiredTlsVersion?: string;
  
  // Resource limits
  maxConcurrentConnections?: number;
  maxMemoryUsageMB?: number;
  maxExecutionTimeMs?: number;
  maxResponseSizeMB?: number;
}
```

### Alert Configuration

```typescript
interface AlertConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  alertOnFailure: boolean;
  alertOnRecovery: boolean;
  alertOnSslExpiration: boolean;
  failureThreshold: number;
  recoveryThreshold: number;
  customMessage?: string;
  notificationProviders: string[];
}
```

### Smart Alert Limiting System

The monitoring system implements intelligent alert limiting to prevent notification fatigue while ensuring critical status changes are communicated:

#### Alert Limiting Rules

**Failure Alerts (Maximum 3 per failure sequence):**
1. **Status Change Alert**: Sent immediately when monitor status changes from 'up' to 'down'
2. **Continuation Alerts**: Up to 2 additional alerts sent during extended failures
3. **Alert Suppression**: After 3 alerts, no additional failure notifications until recovery

**Recovery Alerts (Unlimited):**
- Always sent when monitor status changes from 'down' to 'up'
- Resets the failure alert counter for future failure sequences

#### Database Schema Extensions

```typescript
// Additional fields in monitor_results table
interface MonitorResultExtensions {
  consecutiveFailureCount: number;     // Tracks consecutive failures
  alertsSentForFailure: number;       // Tracks alerts sent for current failure sequence
  isStatusChange: boolean;            // Indicates if this result represents a status change
}
```

#### Alert Limiting Logic

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Monitor Check Complete] --> B{Is Monitor Down?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Status Changed?}
    B -->|No| D[Reset Alert Counters]
    
    C -->|Yes| E{Alerts Sent < 3?}
    C -->|No| F{Meets Threshold & Alerts < 3?}
    
    E -->|Yes| G[Send Status Change Alert]
    E -->|No| H[Suppress Alert - Limit Reached]
    
    F -->|Yes| I[Send Continuation Alert]
    F -->|No| H
    
    G --> J[Increment Alert Counter]
    I --> J
    
    D --> K{Status Changed to Up?}
    K -->|Yes| L[Send Recovery Alert]
    K -->|No| M[No Alert Needed]
    
    style G fill:#ff9999
    style I fill:#ff9999
    style L fill:#99ff99
    style H fill:#cccccc
```

#### Implementation Details

The alert limiting system is implemented in the `MonitorService.saveMonitorResult()` method with the following key features:

1. **Consecutive Failure Tracking**: Each monitor result tracks the number of consecutive failures
2. **Alert Counter Management**: Tracks how many alerts have been sent for the current failure sequence
3. **Status Change Detection**: Identifies when a monitor transitions between up/down states
4. **Threshold-Based Alerting**: Respects configured failure thresholds before triggering alerts
5. **Counter Reset on Recovery**: Resets all counters when monitor returns to 'up' status

**Example Alert Sequence:**
```
Monitor Status: UP → DOWN (Alert #1: Status Change)
Monitor Status: DOWN → DOWN (Alert #2: Continuation)  
Monitor Status: DOWN → DOWN (Alert #3: Continuation)
Monitor Status: DOWN → DOWN (Suppressed: Limit reached)
Monitor Status: DOWN → UP (Recovery Alert: Always sent)
```

#### Benefits

- **Prevents Alert Fatigue**: Maximum 3 failure alerts per incident
- **Maintains Visibility**: Critical status changes always reported
- **Smart Recovery**: Recovery alerts always sent to confirm resolution
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of alert history and suppression decisions
