## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Core tables for status pages functionality
status_pages (id, organization_id, project_id, name, slug, custom_domain, visibility, branding_config, settings, is_published)
status_page_components (id, status_page_id, name, description, monitor_id, current_status, display_order)
incidents (id, status_page_id, title, status, impact, started_at, resolved_at, auto_created, monitor_id)
incident_updates (id, incident_id, status, message, display_at)
status_page_subscribers (id, status_page_id, email, phone, subscribed_component_ids, is_verified, verification_token, unsubscribe_token)
status_page_metrics (id, component_id, date, uptime_percentage, downtime_minutes)
```

### API Endpoints

```
/api/status-pages/                    # CRUD operations
/api/status-pages/[id]/components/    # Component management
/api/status-pages/[id]/incidents/     # Incident management
/api/status-pages/[id]/subscribers/   # Subscriber management
/api/public/status-pages/[slug]/      # Public API
```

### Public Routes

```
/status/[slug]/                       # Public status page
/status/[slug]/incidents              # Incident history
/status/[slug]/subscribe              # Subscription form
/verify-email/[id]                    # Email verification
/unsubscribe/[id]                     # Unsubscribe
```

### Integration Points
