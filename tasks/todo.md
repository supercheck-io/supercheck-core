## Recent Task: Fix Dokploy Sign-in 502 Error

### Problem

Sign-in was failing on Dokploy with a 502 error, while working fine locally.

### Root Cause Analysis

- Application was starting successfully and processing authentication requests
- Database migrations were completing properly
- Issue was related to Better Auth configuration in production environment

### Fixes Implemented

1. **Updated Better Auth Configuration** (`app/src/utils/auth.ts`)

   - Added `baseURL` configuration using `BETTER_AUTH_URL`
   - Added `trustedOrigins` for production environment
   - Ensures proper CORS and origin handling in production

2. **Enhanced Health Check** (`app/src/app/api/health/auth/route.ts`)

   - Created comprehensive authentication health check endpoint
   - Tests database connection, auth configuration, and required tables
   - Provides detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting

3. **Updated Docker Health Checks**

   - Modified both `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose-external.yml`
   - Changed from basic HTTP check to authentication health check
   - Better detection of authentication system readiness

4. **Documentation** (`docs/DOKPLOY_AUTHENTICATION_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)
   - Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide
   - Environment variable checklist
   - Step-by-step fix process
   - Common issues and solutions

### Required Environment Variables for Dokploy

```bash
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-32-character-hex-secret-here

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app-domain.dokploy.app
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/supercheck?sslmode=require
```

### Testing

After deployment, test the authentication health check:

```bash
curl https://your-app-domain.dokploy.app/api/health/auth
```

Should return:

  "timestamp": "...",
  "checks": {
    "environment": { "status": "healthy" },
    "database": { "status": "healthy" },
    "auth": { "status": "healthy" },
    "tables": { "status": "healthy" },
    "session": { "status": "healthy" }
  }
