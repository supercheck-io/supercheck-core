# Heartbeat and Monitoring System Fixes

This document outlines all the fixes implemented to resolve issues with the heartbeat monitoring system and notifications.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Heartbeat Ping URL Database Call Errors
**Problem**: Database calls were failing in heartbeat endpoints due to incorrect `await db()` syntax.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed both `/api/heartbeat/[token]/route.ts` and `/api/heartbeat/[token]/fail/route.ts`
- Updated database calls to use `db` directly instead of `await db()`
- Added proper error handling and comprehensive logging

### 2. Alert Notifications Not Working for Heartbeat Monitors
**Problem**: Heartbeat monitors weren't sending alert notifications when status changed.

**Solution**:
- Created new notification trigger endpoint: `/api/monitors/[id]/notify`
- Enhanced heartbeat endpoints to trigger notifications on status changes
- Implemented proper status change detection using recent monitor results
- Added support for both recovery and failure notifications

### 3. TypeScript Compilation Errors in Runner Service
**Problem**: Multiple TypeScript errors in notification service metadata interface.

**Solution**:
- Fixed metadata interface in `notification.service.ts` to include all required properties
- Added flexible `[key: string]: any` index signature for extensibility
- Fixed nodemailer method name from `createTransporter` to `createTransport`
- Resolved all missing property errors (duration, monitorType, details, etc.)

### 4. Enhanced Alert Configuration Handling
**Problem**: Alert settings weren't being properly saved or validated during monitor creation.

**Solution**:
- Improved monitor creation API to handle alert configurations
- Added proper validation for alert settings
- Enhanced form change detection for monitor editing
- Fixed alert icon status display

## Implementation Details

### Heartbeat Notification System

#### Manual Notification Trigger
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/monitors/[id]/notify`
- **Purpose**: Allows manual triggering of notifications for status changes
- **Features**:
  - Validates monitor existence and alert configuration
  - Checks notification provider settings
  - Respects alert configuration (failure/recovery settings)
  - Saves alert history for tracking
  - Supports multiple notification providers (Slack, Email, Webhook)

#### Enhanced Heartbeat Endpoints
- **Success Ping**: `GET/POST /api/heartbeat/[token]`
  - Updates monitor status to 'up'
  - Records successful monitor result
  - Triggers recovery notification if previously down
  
- **Failure Ping**: `GET/POST /api/heartbeat/[token]/fail`
  - Updates monitor status to 'down' 
  - Records failure monitor result with error details
  - Triggers failure notification if previously up

### Status Change Detection
- Uses recent monitor results to determine if status actually changed
- Prevents duplicate notifications for same status
- Tracks `isStatusChange` flag for proper notification triggering

### Notification Features

#### Rich Metadata Support
- Source tracking (IP, User-Agent, Origin)
- Error details and exit codes for failures
- Timestamps and recovery information
- Dashboard URLs for easy navigation

#### Provider Support
- **Slack**: Rich attachments with fields and color coding
- **Email**: HTML/text format support (ready for SMTP)
- **Webhook**: Full payload forwarding
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new provider types

### Alert History Integration
- All notifications are logged to alert history
- Status tracking (sent/failed/pending)
- Error message capture for debugging
- Provider usage tracking

## Testing and Verification

### Heartbeat Monitor Testing
1. Create heartbeat monitor with alert settings enabled
2. Configure notification providers (Slack recommended for testing)
3. Test success ping: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/heartbeat/[your-token]`
4. Test failure ping: `curl http://localhost:3000/api/heartbeat/[your-token]/fail`
5. Verify notifications in configured channels
6. Check alert history for logged notifications

### Build Verification
- All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- Runner service builds successfully without warnings
- Proper type safety maintained throughout

## Code Quality Improvements

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks around all operations
- Graceful degradation when notifications fail
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

### Type Safety
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Flexible metadata interface supporting all use cases
- Compile-time validation of API contracts

### Logging Enhancement
- Structured logging with consistent prefixes
- Debug information for troubleshooting
- Performance and status tracking

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: Base URL for dashboard links in notifications
- Database connection strings for both app and runner services

### Alert Configuration
Monitors must have `alertConfig.enabled = true` to send notifications:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "alertOnFailure": true,
  "alertOnRecovery": true,
  "customMessage": "Optional custom message"
}
```

### Notification Provider Setup
- Slack: Webhook URL required
- Email: SMTP configuration needed
- Webhook: Target URL required

## Performance Considerations

### Efficient Status Detection
- Single database query to check recent results
- Minimal overhead for status change detection
- Optimized notification triggering logic

### Asynchronous Operations
- Non-blocking notification sending
- Parallel provider notification handling
- Graceful handling of provider failures

## Security Enhancements

### Input Validation
- Proper request parsing and sanitization
- Token validation for heartbeat endpoints
- Error message sanitization

### Access Control
- Monitor ownership validation
- Provider configuration security
- Audit trail through alert history

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Email Provider**: Full SMTP implementation
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent notification spam
3. **Notification Templates**: Customizable message formats
4. **Escalation Rules**: Multi-level alerting
5. **Maintenance Windows**: Scheduled notification suppression

### Monitoring Capabilities
1. **Notification Metrics**: Success/failure rates by provider
2. **Alert Fatigue Prevention**: Intelligent grouping and summarization
3. **Provider Health Monitoring**: Track provider availability
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time notification status

This implementation provides enterprise-grade monitoring capabilities with robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and reliable notification delivery.
